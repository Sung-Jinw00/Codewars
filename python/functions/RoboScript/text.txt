1.getTokens: ✅
- accepts no arguments and returns the tokens present in source in order as an array. ✅
- should ignore all whitespace characters and comments (except within a token) ✅
- should throw if it encounters one or more invalid tokens in the process :
	- F, L, R, Fn, Ln, Rn, (, ), )n, pn, Pn, q ✅
	- positive n ✅
	- Whitespaces ('pn', 'Fn', ')n' do not contain any whitespace themselves). ✅
	- single line comments (optional code) // ... (\n|EOF) ✅
	- multiline comments /* ... */ (ne peuvent pas etre imbriquer) ✅
	they cannot be within a token itself (e.g. F/* ... */37, F// ... \n37, F    37). ✅
	- Zero postfixes (e.g. F0, L0, and P0) ✅
	- No Leading zeroes (e.g. F03, P065) ✅
Do not perform any form of analysis checking the order of the tokens or whether a particular pattern invoked actually exists, etc. ✅
Such errors should be left to later stages. ✅

2.convertToRaw:
- accepts 1 argument tokens (an array of tokens from getTokens) ✅
- returns an array of raw commands from processing the tokens. ✅
- "Raw commands" contains F, L and R only ✅
- pattern declarations and calls position doesn't matter. ✅
- patterns (p<n>...q) can "see" pattern definitions in its own scope and in any subsequent parent scopes.`
	If more than one pattern with the same identifier is defined, it's still valid if provided that they all appear in different scopes.
	The definition of the pattern in the innermost scope takes precedence
	Pattern redefinition in the same scope is not allowed and should throw an error at some stage. ✅
- Empty (pattern definitions / bracketed repeat sequences) p<n>q, (), ()23 is accepted. ✅
- bracketed sequences with no pattern definitions are accepted ✅
- bracketed sequence executed 0 times should simply be ignored. ✅
- should throw :
	- Unmatched bracketing and/or pattern definition sequences ✅
	- Nesting pattern definitions within bracketed sequences, e.g. (p0/* ... */q), invoked or not. ✅
	- invoke a non-existent pattern ✅
	- Attempting to invoke an infinitely recursive pattern of any form

3.executeRaw: ✅
- receives an array of raw commands (only F, L and/or R) returned from your convertToRaw ✅
- returns a string representation of the path that the MyRobot walks on the floor, e.g. "*  \r\n*  \r\n***\r\n  *\r\n***\r\n*  \r\n***\r\n  *\r\n***". ✅

4.execute ✅
- accepts no arguments ✅
- combines the three previous instance methods in one go and returns the string representation of the MyRobot's path. ✅
